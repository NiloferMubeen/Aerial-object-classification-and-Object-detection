# Aerial-Object Classification & Object Detection  
> A dual-task framework for classifying and localising objects in aerial imagery.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary  
This project implements two key tasks on aerial (drone/UAV/satellite-style) imagery:  
- **Image Classification** â€“ determining an overall class label for an input aerial image.  
- **Object Detection** â€“ locating and identifying individual objects in the image via bounding boxes.  
The codebase is designed to support experimentation with different backbones, augmentations, and datasets tailored to aerial-view challenges.

ðŸ”§ Key Features

Dual-task support: classification + detection.

Modular scripts and pipelines for flexibility (swap backbones, augmentations, datasets).

Visualisation utilities (confusion matrices, bounding-box overlay) for qualitative assessment.

Focus on aerial imagery: designed to handle the unique challenges of overhead views.
